Latest development of popular plugin Buddypress Gifts. Send a gift image and message to user in BuddyPress profile using activity stream function.

== Description ==

This plugin is based on Buddypress Gifts developed by Warut and later given rebirth by Slawomir Kroczak. Because this author also abandoned his project I have decided to give it third life.

Kindly note:-

I have updated plugin to version 1.2+. if you get a redeclare error in your admin page after activating the new plugin than you need to deactivate the old plugin starting with bp-gift and than you can activate the new plugin starting with buddypress-gift . This will solve your error.

Buddypress Gifts latest 2014 gives user ability to send gifts image to other members in BuddyPress. It use activity stream to keep the gifts sent information.

Member can choose a gift from gift box in others member gifts tab and type a message to receiver member.
Receiver member can delete or reply message using activity stream function in own profile.
Administrator can upload delete and edit gifts item in backend admin dashboard

Note-This plugin at present is not fully compaible with Multisites. Work is under progress and very soon we will update the plugin to work for multisites. Users can test and report bugs.

It is now integrated to MyCred point system as Well. But at a time only single point system will owrk not both.
